# flixel-waveform
<sup>This is an addon for [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel)</sup>

A simple (I hope) `FlxSprite` extension that allows for drawing waveforms.

Should work on native targets. Currently ***not*** working on HTML5 & Flash because they do not expose audio buffer data.

Check out the [sample](https://github.com/ACrazyTown/flixel-waveform/tree/main/sample) for instructions on how to use.
