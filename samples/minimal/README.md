# Minimal

A minimal sample project that only has a waveform (with no additional parameters changed outside of the constructor) and play/pause functionality using the space bar.

To visualize a different audio file, you can simply drag and drop your desired audio file to the window. Audio format support depends on the build target. Native targets support only WAV and OGG/Vorbis while HTML5 supports any audio format your browser supports.
